Distance growth curves measure stature and velocity growth curves measure peak height velocity (PHV), which is the when growth spurt occurs. When compared to a population velocity curve, we can see how an individual's PHV differs from the norms of their gender. When compared to growth chart, we can determine the individual's trajectory for stature and what percentile their current growth status is at.
