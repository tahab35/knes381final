title: "Who am I?"
---

My full name is Taha Ahmad Butt. I am currently in my 4th year taking a BSc in Kinesiology. I am a research assistant with the Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre under the SHRed study, as well as the Sensorimotor Neuroscience Laboratory. I run two clubs on campus; Campaign for Uyghurs UCalgary and UCalgary for RMHC Alberta.

I enjoy playing tennis and soccer, hiking, going on road trips, and eating food. I love trying new restaurants, especially from different cultures! Here are some pictures from some of the fantastic places I've eaten in Calgary:
